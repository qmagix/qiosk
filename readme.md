I want to create app/system to display photos and videos on a TV o rany large display, where the user also can manage the media and do the selection and ordering of the display of the assets, and define display time for each selected photo.

The backend let's use PHP laravel + sqlite/mysql + S3, with user accounts and auth. 

The frontend use electron?/vanilla js/react/vue... I am not sure, any recommendations? frontend let's it light weight enought but can also have enough support for various transition effect (mostlt css?)
